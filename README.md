# Quick Payload Switcher

Quick Payload Switcher for A9LH and B9S. It can switch between payloads (to switch between CFWs), and it can rename arm9loaderhax.bin to arm9loaderhax_si.bin and vice-versa. Please Read the documentation below.

## Usage (Payload Switcher) First, install the CIA using FBI/NASA/DevMenu/whatever.

### If your original payload is named "/arm9loaderhax.bin", "/arm9loaderhax_si.bin" or "boot.firm" 
1) Name your secondary payload (the one you want to quickswitch) "/arm9loaderhax_switch.bin". 
2) Run the app whenever you want to switch, and reboot the console.

### If your original payload is named something else (ex. "/banana.bin") 
1) Name your secondary payload (the one you want to quickswitch) "/arm9loaderhax_switch.bin". 
2) Create a file named "/payloadswitch-in.cfg" and write the path there (ex. "/banana.bin") 
3) Run the app whenever you want to switch, and reboot the console.

### If you want to switch with more payloads 
1) Name your other payloads "/arm9loaderhax_switch_up.bin", "/arm9loaderhax_switch_down.bin", "/arm9loaderhax_switch_left.bin" and/or "/arm9loaderhax_switch_right.bin". (This applies even if the user has B9S and not A9LH, name the other payloads like this)
2) To switch to them, just hold the correct DPAD button while starting the application. This will make the app replace your main payload (ex. /arm9loaderhax.bin) with that payload (ex. /arm9loadrhax_switch_up.bin").

### If your secondary payload is named something else (ex. "/somepayload.bin") 
1) Create a file named "/payloadswitch-out.cfg" and write the path there (ex. "/somepayload.bin") 
2) Use the app.

### To stop the console from rebooting when using this (on v1.1 or later) Just hold the L button while running it.

### For information about renaming the payloads for screeninit/noscreeninit behaviour, read "Modes"

## Modes

### Mode 1: Normal (normal) 
To use this mode (which by default only switches between payloads to boot), simply delete any file named /payloadswitch-mode.cfg , or make sure that file has "normal" written, without the quotes. 

While in normal mode, if you want to toggle between noscreeninit/screeninit mode (on an A9LH installation that supports it, like Aurora Wright's latest A9LH, which screeninit/noscreeninit merged and relies on filenames to run in one mode or the other), hold R and X while starting this app. R and X will, just for that one time, use Alternate mode. 

If you wish to rename the payload AND switch payloads, hold Y and X instead to use "Mixed" mode. 

### Mode 2: Alternate (alternate) 
To use this mode (which by default only renames the payload as arm9loaderhax.bin<>arm9loaderhax_si.bin), create a file named /payloadswitch-mode.cfg , and write "alternate" in it, without the quotes. While in alternate mode, if you want to use Normal mode once (to switch between CFWs), hold R and X while starting the app. If you want to use "Mixed" behaviour, which will switch and rename the payload, hold Y and X instead. 

### Mode 3: Mixed (mixed) 
Mixed mode is both Normal and Alternate. It will always rename AND switch the payload to boot. To use it, create a file named /payloadswitch-mode.cfg and write "mixed" in it, without the quotes. While in mixed mode, if you wish to use Normal mode, hold R and X while starting the app.Quick Payload Switcher for A9LH and B9S.
